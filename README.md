üöó Car Insurance Prediction Web App
This is a Flask-based web application that predicts car insurance approval based on user inputs using a trained Random Forest model. It features a simple HTML interface and visualizes prediction probabilities with Plotly.

‚ú® Features
Input Form: Collects car and policyholder details from the user.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model for predictions.

Prediction Visualization: Displays prediction probabilities (e.g., approval likelihood) using interactive Plotly bar graphs.

Flask Backend: Robust backend built with Flask and Scikit-learn for handling requests and model inference.

HTML Frontend: Simple and intuitive user interface rendered with HTML templates.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the Car Insurance Prediction Web App up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the ML Model
The application requires a trained machine learning model (systum.pkl). This model is generated by running the provided Jupyter Notebook:

Open and run all cells in the analysis.ipynb notebook. This will preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, and save it as systum.pkl in the appropriate directory.

5. Start the Flask App
Once the model file (systum.pkl) is generated, you can start the Flask web application:

python app.py

The application will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser to access the Car Insurance Prediction Web App.
